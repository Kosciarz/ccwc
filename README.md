# CCWC

This is a C++ implementation of the wc Linux tool written by me.

It supports four different options:

1. -c: Count the number of bytes in the input file.
2. -l: Count the number of lines in the input file.
3. -w: Count the number of words in the input file.
4. -m: Count the number of characters in the input file.

## Installation

To use CCWC:

1. Clone the git repository:

     `git clone https://github.com/Kosciarz/ccwc.git`

2. Build the executable:

    `make`
